I've been wanting to create a personal website for quite some time now. This one is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), with the [al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio) theme. I've customized it quite a bit to suit my preferences. Eventually, I plan to build a more professional looking website using JavaScript, but until then, I want this one to be out there.

This site showcases my personal projects and academic notes, along with some fun extras like occasional blog posts and book reviews.
