<blockquote>
  <p>Quotes are essentially heurisitcs or abstractions, they are short sentences that encapsulate deeper more complex ideas(often spoken/written by great people). Someone spent a lot time and effort in understanding some truth whether it be about human behaviour, science or war, and the main idea/takeaway of this finding can be useful to the masses either because it gives a direct actionable rule to improve your life, a quick answer to a very difficult question or just a funny anecdote/pun to have a chuckle. a lot of energy had to be put into coming up with this idea/fact and often explaining why it's correct or true is equally difficult(someitmes impossible\\\*If the person who said the quote never explained any further and just died with that secret, Buddha for example, they understood it but never shared it)\\\Also most people don't ask why? they just want quick answers that can make their life instantly better so quotes are basically it, they tell you exactly what you need nothing more nothing less, there is a class of quotes though that require you to put in some work to actually understand what they are trying to convey</p>
