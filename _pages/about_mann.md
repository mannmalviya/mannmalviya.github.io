Hi, I'm Mann Malviya ðŸ‘‹. I'm a senior at UCSC majoring in Computer Science(with a minor in Math). I am an International student from India.

I've spent a lot of time writing C code, learning how Operating Systems work, and understanding the fundamentals of computer architecture. At the same time, I'm also drawn to the world of AI. Currently, I'm working on a production-ready RAG chatbot for a company's private knowledge base as part of my internship at Chelsio Communications. This project has led me to further explore the internals of how LLMs actually work under the hood.

Outside of my engineering interests, I like to lift weights, run, practice Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu & boxing and play/study chess.
