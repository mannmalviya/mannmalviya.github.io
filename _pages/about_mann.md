Hi, I'm Mann Malviya ðŸ‘‹, I am a senior at UCSC majoring in Computer Science(and minoring in Math). I am an International student from India.

I have spent a lot of time writting C code, learning how Operating Systems work, and understanding the fundamentals of computer architecture. At the same time, I'm also drawn to the world of AI, currently I am working on a production ready RAG chat bot for a companies private knowledge base as part of my internship at Chelsio Communications. This project has led me to further trying to understand the internals of how LLMs actually work on the inside.

Aside from engineering interests, I like to lift weights, run, practice Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu & boxing and play/study chess.
