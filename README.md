# My Personal Website

This is the codebase for my personal static website, built using **[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)** and the **[Al-Folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio)** theme. The site is hosted via **[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)**.

> ⚙️ Most of the code in this repository originates from the Al-Folio theme and has been customized for my personal needs.  
> 🧠 These customizations were guided with the help of LLM-based tools such as **ChatGPT** and **Devin Wiki**.

Feel free to explore, fork, or reach out if you're building something similar!
